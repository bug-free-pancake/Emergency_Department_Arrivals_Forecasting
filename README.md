# Emergency Department Arrival Forecasting

## Overview

This project was completed as Part 1 of the individual assignment for the **RS: Spatiotemporal Data Analysis** course.  
The task is to analyze and forecast daily patient arrivals at a hospital emergency department using time series techniques.

The assignment explores different forecasting approaches, including:
- Time series decomposition
- Exponential smoothing
- ARIMA modeling
- K-Nearest Neighbors regression

## Dataset

The dataset, `ed_time_series.csv`, contains:
- A daily time series of patient arrivals to the emergency department
- A `date` column and a corresponding `arrivals` column

The objective is to develop forecasting models that help predict future arrival counts for operational decision-making.
